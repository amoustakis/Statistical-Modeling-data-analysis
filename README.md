A series of 3 assignments conducted as part of the module ‘Statistical Modelling’ for the MSc ‘Data Science and Machine Learning’. The assignments include:
•	Linear Regression: Linear Model, Mathematical Proofs, Scatter Plot, Hypothesis Testing, Confidence Intervals
•	Polynomial Regression: Polynomial Model, Points of Influence (Cook Distance, DFFiTS, DFBETAS, hii), F-test, t-test, AIC, Cp, $R^2$, Confidence Intervals, Plots, extra: Ridge and  Lasso Regression
•	Poisson and Logistic Regression: Statistical Testing (Wald and Deviance), Confidence Intervals, Plots, Points of Influence, Interactions, ROC curve
The code is written in R-studio.
